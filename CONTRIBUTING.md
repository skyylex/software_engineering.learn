## Contributing

#### We'd love to see more resources about software! 
Please propose your changes via **pull request** or create new issue.

### Persistence

All resources **should be copied and placed in the Sources** folder to prevent an information's loss.

Please use one of the following formats to make a copy:

- **.md** (Markdown)
- **pdf**

### Style

Each new item should contain **authors**, **title** of the paper (presentation/translation), **some text that explains 
why it is interesting**, the last attribute is **link** to the copied document (with the explanation of where 
this link leads to). 

For example:

1. **John Doe, "The best article about Turing's machine".** This article is unique article about essentials 
of Turing's machine.
